# Gitignore-for-XCode
A sample of gitignore file for XCode

I use this file when initilizing a new iOS project. I would save a lot of time in the furture. Expecially, when I wok on a team more than 5 people. The .DS_Store and the xcuserdata cause a lot of trouble and headache.

This gitignore file will save the day.
